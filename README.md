# Sorts
This is just a project that I'm making to study for a Comp Sci final where I implement every type of sorting algorithm that is on the final and represent it textually. After the final, for some practice, I'll implement some other sorts like bubble and shell, but for now I'm focusing on the first five sorts.

# Types of Sorts
Format: \<Type\>, \<Memory efficiency\>, \<Done\>
  1. Merge Sort, O(n\*log(n)), Yes
  2. Selection Sort, O(n^2), Yes
  3. Insertion Sort, O(n^2), Yes
  4. Quick Sort, O(n\*log(n)), Yes
  5. Heap Sort, O(n\*log(n)), No
