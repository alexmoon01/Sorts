# Sorts
This is just a project that I'm making to study for a Comp Sci final where I implement every type of sorting algorithm that I can find and represent it textually.

# Types of Sorts
Format: \<Type\>, \<Memory efficiency\>, \<Done\>
  1. Merge Sort, O(n*log(n)), Yes
  2. Selection Sort, O(n^2), No
  3. Insertion Sort, O(n^2), No
  4. Quick Sort, O(n*log(n)), No
  5. Heap Sort, O(n*log(n)), No
